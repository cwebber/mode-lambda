mode-lambda - sprite-based 2D graphics engine (wip)

XXX add text rendering
XXX make chaos/gui/mode-lambda
XXX trim/reposition inside a sprite (could be used for "blowing up" something?)

MAYBE:
- parents for localized rotation? (skeletal animation)
- rotation about a different origin
- make animated gif creator (add screenshots to GL)
- ensure that layers can be used effectively for minimap
- add something like pict-finders
