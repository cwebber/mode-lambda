mode-lambda - sprite-based 2D graphics engine

xxx write docs
xxx get-bonus is MUCH slower in full-screen

MAYBE:
- parents for localized rotation? (skeletal animation)
- rotation about a different origin
- make animated gif creator (add screenshots to GL)
- ensure that layers can be used effectively for minimap
- add something like pict-finders
- trim/reposition inside a sprite (could be used for "blowing up" something?)
- make effects compatible with retroarch (or just get a much better crt effect)
- support full retina resolution: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/CapturingScreenContents/CapturingScreenContents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012302-CH10-SW33 [or not because we just scale anyways]

- better crt?
